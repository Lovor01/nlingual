Here you can select what post types will support localization. Supported post types will include a meta box for setting the language and associated translations. In most instances, all publicly accessible objects should be enabled.

You can also select which navigation menu and sidebar locations will be localized. Supported locations will be replaced with versions for each language, allowing you to assign unique items/widgets to them. It is usually best to enable this for all locations since they usually contain custom-written content.
