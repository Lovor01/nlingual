The <strong>Languages & Translation</strong> box allows you to assign a language to this <?php echo $singular; ?>, from the list of languages that have been registered <a href="<?php echo admin_url('admin.php?page=nlingual-languages'); ?>" target="_blank">here</a> for use. Once you assign a language, you can also assign the translated versions of the <?php echo $singular; ?> in each of the other languages.

If you don't have a translated version for a particular language yet, you can select the option to create a new one; a copy of the current post will be created automatically for you to work from.

When you save your changes, certain fields and settings will be copied to itâ€™s sister translations, synchronizing them. The exact fields/settings that will be synchronized is controlled <a href="<?php echo admin_url('admin.php?page=nlingual-sync'); ?>" target="_blank">here</a>, along with what will be copied when creating a new translation (usually everything).
