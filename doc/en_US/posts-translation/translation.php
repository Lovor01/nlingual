On this screen you can view at a glance what language every post is in, as well as what it's translations are. You can also filter the list to show only <?php echo $plural; ?> of a particular language.

The <strong>Quick Edit</strong> option will allow you to quickly change the language or assign translations to a <?php echo $singular; ?>, while Bulk Edit will allow you to change the language of many <?php echo $plural; ?> at once.

If you make changes to a <?php echo $singular; ?> from here, certain fields and settings will be copied to itâ€™s sister translations, synchronizing them. The exact fields/settings that will be synchronized is controlled <a href="<?php echo admin_url('admin.php?page=nlingual-sync'); ?>" target="_blank">here</a>.
